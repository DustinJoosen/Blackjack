-The dealer starts with collecting the bets of all players.
-The dealer gives two cards to all players, including themself. These two cards are open.

-Ask all players to either hit or stand(and later, maybe to split)
-If hit, give the player a new card. If stand, wait for the dealer to finish.

-Repeat above two lines until either a player/dealer is bust, a blackjack has occured or both players stand.

-Calculate who has more points.
-Give bets back accordingly.

When player wins: twice the bet.
When player has blackjack:  tripple the bet.
When the game is a tie: return the normal bets to everyone.
When lost to dealer: half the bet.
When bust, none of the bet.
