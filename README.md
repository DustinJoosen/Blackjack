#Houserules<br/>

-The dealer starts with collecting the bets of all players.<br/>
-The dealer gives two cards to all players, including themself. These two cards are open.<br/>

-Ask all players to either hit or stand(and later, maybe to split)<br/>
-If hit, give the player a new card. If stand, wait for the dealer to finish.<br/>

-Repeat above two lines until either a player/dealer is bust, a blackjack has occured or both players stand.<br/>

-Calculate who has more points.<br/>
-Give bets back accordingly.<br/>

When player wins: twice the bet.<br/>
When player has blackjack:  tripple the bet.<br/>
When lost or tied to dealer: half the bet.<br/>
When bust, none of the bet.<br/>
